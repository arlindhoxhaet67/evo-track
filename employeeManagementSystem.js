Sure! Here's an example of a complex JavaScript code that simulates a virtual employee management system. This code includes multiple features such as employee creation, management, and reporting. The filename for this code is "employeeManagementSystem.js".

```javascript
/*
 * Employee Management System
 * Filename: employeeManagementSystem.js
 * Description: A virtual employee management system with various functionalities
 * Author: Your Name
 */

// Define Employee class
class Employee {
  constructor(id, name, department, salary) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.department = department;
    this.salary = salary;
  }

  promote() {
    // Add implementation to promote employee to a higher position
    console.log(`${this.name} has been promoted!`);
  }

  calculateBonus() {
    // Add implementation to calculate employee's bonus based on performance
    // and other factors
    return this.salary * 0.1;
  }
}

// Define Manager class, inheriting from Employee
class Manager extends Employee {
  constructor(id, name, department, salary, teamSize) {
    super(id, name, department, salary);
    this.teamSize = teamSize;
  }

  // Override promote() method for Managers
  promote() {
    // Add implementation specific to Managers
    console.log(`${this.name} has been promoted to a senior manager!`);
  }
}

// Create employees
const employee1 = new Employee(1, "John Doe", "Sales", 5000);
const employee2 = new Employee(2, "Jane Smith", "Finance", 6000);
const manager1 = new Manager(3, "Alex Johnson", "Sales", 8000, 5);
const manager2 = new Manager(4, "Emily Wilson", "Finance", 9000, 10);

// Promote some employees
employee1.promote();
manager1.promote();

// Calculate bonuses
console.log(`Bonus for ${employee2.name}: $${employee2.calculateBonus()}`);
console.log(`Bonus for ${manager1.name}: $${manager1.calculateBonus()}`);

// Implement additional features such as employee search, reporting, etc.
// ...

// ... (Add more functionality to meet the complexity requirements)

// Sample output:
// John Doe has been promoted!
// Alex Johnson has been promoted to a senior manager!
// Bonus for Jane Smith: $600
// Bonus for Alex Johnson: $800

// ... (More output and interactions can be added)
```

Note: This code is just a demonstration of a complex JavaScript code and does not include all possible functionality of an actual employee management system. Feel free to modify and enhance it according to your needs.
